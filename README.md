# I'm the one who docs

I created this design because I think that documentation specialists, like Tech Writers, also deserve to have cool swag.

You can grab these files and use them for making T-shirts, mugs, stickers or just use them as a wallpaper on your computer.

Special thanks to **rad89** for fixing the design and providing it in various versions and formats.

If you have any questions or comments, you can reach me at `m.skowron(at)yahoo.pl`.
